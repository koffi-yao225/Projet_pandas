## Les données

Cet ensemble de données contient des informations sur les réservations d'un hôtel de ville et d'un hôtel resort, et comprend des informations telles que la date de la réservation, la durée du séjour, le nombre d'adultes, d'enfants et/ou de bébés, et le nombre de places de parking disponibles, entre autres.

Toutes les informations d'identification personnelle ont été supprimées des données.

Les données proviennent initialement de l'article Hotel Booking Demand Datasets, rédigé par Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida et Luis Nunes pour Data in Brief, volume 22, février 2019.

REMARQUE : Les noms, emails, numéros de téléphone et numéros de carte de crédit figurant dans les données sont synthétiques et ne sont pas des informations provenant de personnes réelles. Par contre, les données sur les hôtels sont réelles et proviennent de la publication mentionnée ci-dessus.
